# sdl2.veand.co

This is the source code repository for the unofficial [SDL2 website](https://sdl2.veand.co). It is a static website that is generated by [Zola](https://getzola.org). Changes applied to the `master` branch is almost immediately live on the website thanks to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)! It currently has only Go-related tutorials but the plan is to eventually have other languages as well.

## Development

To develop this website, one would want to download the `zola` executable so the result can be previewed locally. It can be installed using the instructions [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/). Personally, I download the executable directly from the [Github releases page] and put it where discoverable by my `$PATH` (for me, I put it under `$HOME/.local/bin`).

Once `zola` has been installed, the project can be cloned by running `git clone https://github.com/veandco/sdl2.veand.co`. Once it has been cloned, go into the `sdl2.veand.co` directory and run `zola serve`. It can then be reached locally via http://localhost:1111!

However, it is certainly possible to make small changes such as fixing small typos without touching the command-line. One could simply use Github's file editing feature to make the changes straight on the browser!

### Structure

#### Creating single-page tutorial

To create a single-page tutorial, first go to `content/tutorials/go` and create a directory with slugified title such as `hello-world`. Then create a `_index.md` file and put the following content:

```
+++
title = "Hello World!"
template = "section-tutorials-lang-snippet.html"
sort_by = "weight"
weight = 50
+++

The content of the page goes here!
```

#### Creating multi-page tutorial

To create multi-page tutorial, first go to `content/tutorials/go` and create a directory with slugified title such as `snake`. Then create a `_index.md` file and put the following content:

```
+++
title = "Snake"
template = "section-tutorials-lang-project.html"
page_template = "page-tutorials-lang-project.html"
sort_by = "weight"
weight = 200
+++
```

After that, you can create the first page by creating another file e.g. `setup.md` with the following content:

```
+++
title = "First page"
weight = 0

[taxonomies]
categories = ["go"]
tags = ["snake"]
+++

Content of the first page here!
```

You can create the following pages with the similar set up but increment the `weight`. So the next page would contain something like this:

```
title = "Second Page"
weight = 1

[taxonomies]
categories = ["go"]
tags = ["snake"]
+++

Content of the second page here!
```

The links for the previous and next page will be generated on the HTML page based on the `weight` value.
