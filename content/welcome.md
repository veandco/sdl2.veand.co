### Introduction

Welcome to an unofficial SDL2 companion website! This website is being developed for the purpose of showing a higher-level usage of SDL2. It aims to be a resource that accompanies [SDL2's main website](https://libsdl.org) by providing tutorials whether it's standalone how-to tutorials or project-based tutorials. There's not much here yet but we plan to start with this post! If you would like to contribute, report issues, suggest an idea, feel free to drop them on [Github](https://github.com/veandco/sdl2.veand.co)
